## Refactor & Best Practice Suggestions

1. **Modularize Scripts:**
   - Move utility scripts (e.g., db population, scraping) into a `scripts/` directory.
   - Group related scripts by function (e.g., `db/`, `scraping/`).

2. **Entrypoint:**
   - Create a `main.py` or `app.py` as the unified entrypoint for running the backend/API.

3. **Configuration Management:**
   - Use a `config.py` or `.env` for environment variables and settings.
   - Document all required environment variables in the README.

4. **Testing:**
   - Place all test scripts in the `tests/` directory.
   - Use `pytest` or `unittest` for consistent test structure.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Maintain up-to-date docstrings for all modules and functions.
   - Consider using tools like Sphinx or MkDocs for API documentation.

6. **Type Annotations:**
   - Add type hints to all function signatures for clarity and tooling support.

7. **Logging:**
   - Use Python's `logging` module instead of print statements for better traceability.

8. **Database Migrations:**
   - Use migration tools (e.g., Alembic for SQL) if schema changes are frequent.

9. **Frontend:**
   - Place all static assets in `static/` and reference them in your web interface.

10. **CI/CD:**
    - Add a `.github/workflows/` directory for GitHub Actions (linting, tests, deploy).

---

**Following these recommendations will make your project easier to maintain, scale, and collaborate on.**

If you want, I can:
- Move/rename files and directories as per this structure
- Refactor code for modularity and clarity
- Set up a main entrypoint and config management
- Add a sample test and CI workflow
